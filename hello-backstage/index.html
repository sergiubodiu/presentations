Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. It was created at Spotify and open-sourced in March 2020.
Since open sourcing it, Backstage has become a Sandbox project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

  ## Open Source

  Notes: By building a developer portal on an open platform, you can:

  * Leverage common integrations and best practices developed with the community 
  * Customize those integrations to suit your unique needs

## What is a Developer Portal?

### Software is still eating the world

> "Trends like microservices, SaaS sprawl, and cloud-everything create a chaotic ecosystem for engineers." - Spotify

Note: Every company uses different subsets of these tools and faces different challenges.
Your whole stack is getting more complex;  onboarding and collaboration are becoming more difficult.

<!-- Plugins -->
<section data-markdown>
## What's available by default?

* **Entity Catalog:** catalog software, infrastructure resources, people, teams, etc
* **Documentation-as-code:** a place to read your collection of [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-generated
  documentation
* **Software templates:** Scaffold new software projects, create and publish new VCS repos
* **Authentication:** Integrate with common SSO providers (GitHub, Okta, etc)
* Extensible via **Plugins**

Note: Backstage is constructed out of three parts. We separate Backstage in this way because we see three groups of contributors that work with Backstage in three different ways:
* Core: Base functionality built by core developers in the open source project.
* App: The app is an instance of a Backstage app that is deployed and tweaked. The app ties together core functionality with additional plugins. The app is built and maintained by app developers, usually a productivity team within a company.
* Plugins: Additional functionality to make your Backstage app useful for your company. Plugins can be specific to a company or open sourced and reusable. 

</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Entity Catalog

* Majority of features build on catalog entities
* Track applications, libraries, APIs, teams, systems, database instances, etc
* Define and consume metadata such as description, ownership, relations, tags, entity type, etc
* Searchable by metadata
* Each entity page provides context-aware functionality
</section>

<section data-markdown>
  ## Entity Catalog Sample

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Component
  metadata:
    name: backstage
    description: The source for all your sources
    annotations:
      backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
    tags:
      - nodejs
      - expressjs
  spec:
    type: library
    owner: spotify-engineering
    lifecycle: experimental
  ```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Software Templates

* Catalog entity `kind: Template`
* Define user input via JSON schema
* Define "steps" that perform actions based on user input and template files
* Common built-in actions include:
  * Run Nunjucks templating engine
  * Create new Git repository in GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket
  * Register new repo in catalog
* An "action" is a TypeScript function - write your own to do complex or unique logic
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## TechDocs

* "Annotate" an entity as utilizing mkdocs
* Write documentation as code (markdown)
* Find content across multiple repos using search
* Generate HTML on-the-fly or pre-render using CI job
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Authentication

* Sign-in via Auth0, Atlassian, GitHub, Okta, etc
* Protect pages with scopes
* Protect entities with group/role based rules

  <h1>Extensibility</h1>
  <h3>via</h3>
  <h2 class="r-fit-text">Plugins </h2>
  <aside class="notes">As you saw in the demo, the power of Backstage is in its extensibility and customization. Weâ€™ve seen that power firsthand and wanted to share more on some of the common patterns that we've seen operating Backstage internally at Spotify as people have extended it. </aside>
</section>

<section >
  <h1>Core Functionality</h1>
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-plug" ></i> Backstage is built to be extended</li>

<li class="fragment"><i class="fa fa-linux"></i> Customize for your infrastructure</li> 

<li class="fragment"><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Plugins are npm packages</li> 

<li class="fragment"><i class="fa fa-battery-half"></i> Frontend and backend plugins</li> 

<li class="fragment"><i class="fa fa-battery-full"></i> Core features are plugins too!</li> 

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
  Backstage functionality provided out-of-the-box can be replicated with other products, but Backstage provides:
<ul>
<li>easy-to-modify package</li>
<li>hosted on your own servers</li>
<li>maintained by your own developers</li>
<li>expanded by your own team.</li>
</ul>
